# VSCode-Mobile
This is a mobile port version of Visual Studio Code. But, it's only for Android devices. This repository is here for addition to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org).
# Designed for..
The repository is designed to be opened in **Android Studio**. Put API level to 26, and set package name to **com.bagoflays.codemobile**. Make sure the language is Java.
# Additional thing..
I know you see that, yeah the app doesn't use Kotlin. I only know Java for app development so maybe that's why.
And also the app was made in Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat).
